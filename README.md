## Overview

This project centers around the `MetricTrack_Stocks_Analysis_System.ipynb` notebook. It is structured to:

- **Install Required Libraries:** Automatically install essential packages.
- **Set Up Analysis:** Import libraries, define helper functions, and configure analysis parameters.
- **Execute Data Analysis:** Retrieve stock data and produce interactive visualizations like candlestick charts.

## Features

- **Real-Time Data Acquisition:** Utilizes [yfinance](https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/) to fetch historical and current stock data.
- **Interactive Visualizations:** Leverages [mplfinance](https://github.com/matplotlib/mplfinance) for generating insightful charts.
- **Customizable Analysis Parameters:** Adjust parameters to tailor the analysis to specific stocks or time frames.
- **Modular Notebook Design:** Easy-to-follow cells guide you through the installation, setup, and execution phases.

## Installation

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. Then, install the necessary packages using pip:

```bash
pip install yfinance mplfinance
```

You will also need Jupyter Notebook installed:

```bash
pip install notebook
```

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**

   Start Jupyter Notebook from your terminal:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

3. **Open the Notebook:**

   Open the `MetricTrack_Stocks_Analysis_System.ipynb` file in your browser.

4. **Run the Notebook:**

   Execute each cell sequentially to:
   - Install required libraries.
   - Import necessary modules and functions.
   - Set analysis parameters.
   - Download stock market data and generate visualizations.

## Examples

Hereâ€™s a snippet from the notebook demonstrating key steps:

```python
# Install necessary libraries (if not already installed)
!pip install yfinance mplfinance

# Import libraries
import yfinance as yf
import mplfinance as mpf

# Download stock data for Apple Inc. (AAPL)
data = yf.download("AAPL", start="2022-01-01", end="2022-12-31")

# Plot the stock data using a candlestick chart
mpf.plot(data, type='candle')
```
